"""
Minimal patch to reduce buffering in AsyncTTSStreamer for better AEC timing.
This can be applied to your existing async_tts_module.py
"""

# Key changes to make in AsyncTTSStreamer:

# 1. Reduce queue size from unlimited to small fixed size
# OLD: self.audio_queue = asyncio.Queue()
# NEW: self.audio_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=10)  # ~100ms of audio

# 2. Use smaller chunks when writing to PyAudio
# In _audio_playback_worker, instead of:
#   chunk = await self.audio_queue.get()
#   stream.write(chunk)
# Do:
#   chunk = await self.audio_queue.get()
#   # Split into smaller pieces
#   SMALL_CHUNK_SIZE = 256  # samples
#   chunk_bytes = SMALL_CHUNK_SIZE * 2  # 16-bit
#   
#   for i in range(0, len(chunk), chunk_bytes):
#       sub_chunk = chunk[i:i+chunk_bytes]
#       
#       # Call echo cancellation callback RIGHT before playback
#       if self.echo_cancellation_callback:
#           self.echo_cancellation_callback(sub_chunk)
#       
#       stream.write(sub_chunk)

# 3. Open PyAudio stream with smaller buffer
# OLD: stream = p.open(..., frames_per_buffer=1024)
# NEW: stream = p.open(..., frames_per_buffer=256)

# 4. Add backpressure handling
# When adding to queue, use put() with timeout to avoid infinite buffering:
# try:
#     await asyncio.wait_for(self.audio_queue.put(chunk), timeout=0.1)
# except asyncio.TimeoutError:
#     # Queue is full - this provides natural flow control
#     pass
