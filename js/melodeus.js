// this should have on document start
// that does init by fetching currently connected devices
// and grabs all available devices and popultes dropdowns with settings
// there should be a dropdown to select device (listed by host name and device name)
// (the list of devices is [[device1_config_1, device1_config_2, ...], [device2_config_1, device2_config_2, ...]])
// and then a "add device" button
// that calls the relevant endpoint
// and then repopulates available devices below
// the available devices should also have minus buttons next to them to remove them
// please make all code clear and minimal and self contained
// try to use my typical style I have elsewhere
